Objective:      This program calculates the total dollar amount for the number of lunches
                that the user inputs, it also calulates the average amount spent for the
                lunches. The user will input the total number of lunches they want to input
                and the amount they spent on each lunch. After the average is calculated a
                message is displayed based off the average spent.
